Project Group Members: Cameron Santiago, Katherine Hartley, Juan Veliz, Mary Hanson

# Description

Popular music apps allow a user to listen to music and sometimes follow friends, but users cannot share music, artists, playlists, or concert tickets within these platforms. So, this application creates a more social-centered music experience. Sound Bytes is a music sharing platform that users can use to discover new music or connect with their friends. Additionally, It integrates concerts where users can flag their favorite artists and plan the event with a friend.
